# `useCalendlyEventListener()` 

The `useCalendly()` composable is an easy way if you want to listen to certain [events](https://developer.calendly.com/api-docs/ZG9jOjI3ODM2MTAz-notifying-the-parent-window) provided by calendly.

## Example

Check the [Playground](https://nuxt-calendly-playground.vercel.app/use-calendly-event-listener) for an example of how the `useCalendly()` composable works.

::alert{type="info"}
Load the widget either via the components [Inline Widget](/components/inline-widget), [Popup Widget](/components/popup-widget), and [Popup Button](/popup-button) or the [`useCalendly()`](/composables/use-calendly) composable to listen to certain events
